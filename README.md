# python-Colorama-Modified
The clone of the reporsity Colorama, just modified to fit my needs.
I own none of the code in the colorama folder, all credits goes to: https://github.com/tartley/colorama

# How i modified it
Instead of having to pip install, just place this repo data in your file structure
The code will automatically initalize on import of colours.py

# Why i did this
So, yes i could have installed colorama using pip, and init like that. But there are limitations. These limitations lead me to make this repo.
Basically, school computers don't let me install external modules, so the best option is to clone the module. This is so school computers will work.

# Last notes
Thanks windows... Why do you have to be annoying to code for?
